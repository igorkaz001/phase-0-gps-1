What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with merging repos on github.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I got more practice with merging repos especially working with anther collaborator on the same repo. I learned that the merges can be approved by either party. 


What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I don't rememeber exact questions I asked, but they were along the lines of what command I should enter into the terminal at a specific stage of our session. 


What still confuses you about git?
I am still a bit fuzzy on resolution of git conflicts, but I have a much better understanding of that process after the pairing session. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was a good experience. My pair and the guide worked well with me to solve the challanges step by step.
