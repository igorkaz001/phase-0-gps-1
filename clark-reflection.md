What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
>I was struggling with the sequence of add, commit, push, pull, and when to pull down master or switch branches.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
>The biggest concept was that you cannot clone a repo into another repo. I didn't realize that it mattered what directory you were in when you clone. Knowing this will keep me out of a lot of trouble I think!

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
>I asked my pair to confirm whether my syntax was correct and whether my order of operations was correct. I asked the guide the question about cloning repos


What still confuses you about git?
>I still get confused about when you need to pull down the master branch (because it seems like my local branch is synced with the master when I have just pushed into it). I think this comes into play more when you are working with other in collaboration.


How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
>Pairing in GPS was interesting. My pair was very proficient. It was nice to have the guide there to clarify what is important in the exercise and to make sure we understand what is being asked of us.
